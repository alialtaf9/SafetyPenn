SafetyPenn

Created by Ali Altaf, Brian McNeely, Elliot Boschwitz and Johanna Martens

The application consists of an Android app that can be found in SafetyPenn/ and a Python/Flask that can be found in SafetyPennWeb/

The app is meant to allow students to request Penn escorts and set off a timer that functions as a safety mechanism because in the event of any kind of attack, the user does not turn off the timer and the app then alerts Penn police when it goes off.
