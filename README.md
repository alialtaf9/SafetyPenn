The application consists of an Android app that can be found in SafetyPenn/ and a Python/Flask app that can be found in SafetyPennWeb/

The Python/Flask app is for what we've named the super user. The super user plays the role of campus security and can see a map of where any normal users in need are.

The Android app is for what we've named the normal user. The normal users are the students on campus. A normal user can use the Android app to request a campus security escort as well as to set a timer. The super user is notified when a normal user requests an escort and can notify the normal user that the escort has been sent. If the normal user's timer expires without being manually cancelled, the super user is notified and can send help to the normal user's location.
